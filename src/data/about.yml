          I had the need to do something more creative and fun, wich after some thinking led me on to web development.

          I've been doing everything from HTML, CSS to JavaScript and PHP.

          I listen, and I go to lots of gigs and visit festivals.
          Apart from that I love traveling, crafting and video games."

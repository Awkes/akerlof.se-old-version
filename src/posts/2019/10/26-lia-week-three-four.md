Last two weeks have been a lot of fun. We finally started working for real with our gatsby-themes-project. Basically we've been writing a lot of code, reviewing a lot of code, building a lot of components, and learning a lot of new stuff.

Apart from coding we also...
- ...had a few meetings planning the project, figuring out how to do certain stuff in the best way, and the most important one was getting feedback on our code.
- ...had lectures in basic JavaScript (Datatypes, data structures, DOM and CSS-manipulation) and advanced git (mostly about learning to use rebase).
- ...had one afternoon dedicated to trying out new stuff (We ahead call it Kod-EM). At this particular Kod-EM we got introduced to Firebase and Firestore and tried playing with it for a few hours.

I have to say it's pretty awesome being surrounded by all these great developers, you snap up a lot of knowledge, learn new stuff all the time and you grow as a developer every day.

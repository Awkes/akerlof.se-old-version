Another week has gone by and I've had another great week at We ahead.

This week started with us interns presenting last weeks work to our
superiors and then we got started on the next step of this journey.

From now throughout the rest of this internship, me and my two fellow interns from Nackademin are going to work on a project together. The project is based on the design we did the first week but now we are gonna do it from scratch following We aheads workflow, guidelines and technics. The project will be driven and developed as every other of their in house projects.

So, what is the project?

Gatsby recently introduced something called <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/" target="_blank">Gatsby Themes</a>. The aim with this project is to build a Gatsby Theme based on the design we worked with last week. Together with the theme we're using DatoCMS as data source and Theme UI for theming.

The rest of the week has mostly been a lot of education, studying and trying out the technics we're gonna use. We also made the "boilerplate" for our project. And same as last week, we've had a few meetings and a lecture in We aheads stack.

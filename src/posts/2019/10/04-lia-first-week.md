Last Monday I started my intership at We ahead together with two class mates.
The week went by fast and it's already friday.

On Monday we started the day after lunch-time with an introduction meeting. We got our
own accounts to different tools we needed like GSuite, Trello, Slack, Gitlab, Stack Overflow, Zeplin etc.

Then we got our first assignment, we were handled a design that we on our own were supposed to convert
to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We were free to do it however we wanted and I decided to go with Gatsby since
the last project I did (this website) was made with Gatsby and I wanted to continue working on my Gatsby skills.

Now at the end of the week we kind of finnished our first project and after the weekend we're gonna present the
result and then we're supposed to somehow continue working on this project.

Apart from working on the project, we've also had a few follow up meetings, a 1-on-1 meeting with my supervisor and a lecture in basic git.

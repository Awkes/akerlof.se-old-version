Hi and welcome to my blog.

On this blog I'm planning to write about different subjects related to my life as a frontend developer.

For starters I'm gonna use this blog as some kind of diary to document what I do and what I learn
during my upcoming internship at <a href="https://www.weahead.se" target="_blank">WeAhead</a>.

My internship starts next Monday (2019-09-30) and I'll be there for ten weeks.
If everything works out alright I'm also gonna be spending eleven weeks there next spring.
